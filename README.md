## üìå Project Summary

**Engineering Automations** is a curated collection of **UIPath automation workflows** tailored for the needs of **engineering and project-based companies**. These automations are designed to streamline repetitive tasks, reduce manual effort, and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of day-to-day operations.

### üîß What It Does

This repository includes workflows that automate:

- üìä **Data Extraction & Transformation**  
  Extract data from PDFs (like technical reports, outlook threads, etc), and convert it into structured formats for analysis or reporting.

- üóÇÔ∏è **Project File Management**  
  Automatically create and maintain folder structures, apply naming conventions, and archive files.

- üìë **Diagram Markups**  
  Markup PDF diagrams using project-specific data.

- üßæ **Prolog Converge Scraper**  
  Srape information from the Prolog Converge Construction Project Management Software and convert it into structured Excel data.

### üéØ Who It's For

This project is ideal for:

- Engineering teams looking to adopt RPA without building workflows from scratch
- Project managers aiming to reduce time spent on repetitive documentation
- Companies seeking to improve consistency and reduce human error in engineering processes

The workflows are modular and customizable, making it easy to adapt them to your specific tools, templates, and processes.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Some workflows in this repository are still a **Work In Progress (WIP)** and may require further development or testing before production use.
